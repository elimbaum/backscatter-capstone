# Receiver Pseudocode

# This section runs in GNURadio
receiver:
    load samples from radio
    retune to ASK center frequency
    low pass filter
    convert complex values to magnitudes
    send to decoder

# All other sections run in Python
decoder:
    ingest raw values from Receiver
    binary slice

    # Coarse Pulse Extraction
    pulses = run-length encode sliced data

    if any pulse is below is below threshold:
        combine adjacent pulses

    symbols = FM0 decode pulses
    packet = unpack symbols

    match = correlate packet against access code (0xe15ae893)

    if no match:
        continue

    sqn = read sequence number
    if sqn is out of order:
        continue

    n = read packet length
    r = read n bytes
    add r to plot_values
    
plot:
    every 100 ms:
        replot plot_values
