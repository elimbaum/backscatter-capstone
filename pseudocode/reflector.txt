# Transmitter Pseudocode
# Continuously takes sensor readings and sends them out
#
# Target: Arduino Uno (ATMega328)

setup:
    configure i/o
    configure timers

    # load access code, sqn, length
    enqueue packet header

loop:
    s = count empty slots in the queue
    repeat s times:
        r = measure magnetic sensor
        enqueue r

        if packet is full:
            # load access code, sqn, length
            enqueue packet header

# Runs every millisecond
timer interrupt:
    pull a bit off the queue
    ask modulate bit on the RF switch
